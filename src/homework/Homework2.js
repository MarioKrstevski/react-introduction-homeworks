1. Make a WeeklyTracker component that allows you to track multiple Habbit(s),
Each habit will have a name and a goal (how many times per week it needs to be done)

in the UI 
-  add a button that will be used to add 1 points to a habit
- prevent the user to add more points than the goal is
- When the goal is reached, make the component glow ( any css, green text color is just fine)

Here is how it would look like

Brush teeth -- 0/14
Work out -- 1/3


2. Make a visual keyboard (make a button for all the letters), and at the top there should be 
a placeholder (a div) where it will display the message. The message starts with "Today I will "
and by clicking on each button the corresponding letter will be added at the end.

(To solve the problem you don't need to add all letters, just enough to test the code logic, it should work
the same with 2 buttons and with 200 buttons, but at the end add all the letters from the english alphabet and a few
usefull ones as well (.,space!?)
